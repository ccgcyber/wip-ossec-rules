#Information about rule id 370023

# Introduction #

Rule ID 370023 is an administrative rule informing the administrator that a host key is configured for use, but does not appear to be on the system.

This error may occur after upgrading OpenSSH without installing a new host key that it expects to be present. The example below occurred after upgrading to the latest OpenSSH code. ecdsa support was recently [committed](http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=128325589424307&w=2), but no key was created on this system.


# Details #

## Example ##
```
Sep 18 14:58:47 ix sshd[11816]: error: Could not load host key: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
```

## Remediation ##

Using [ssh-keygen](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keygen&sektion=1), add the appropriate host key to the system. The above example, and command below, are from an OpenBSD system.

Using the example log message from above, the command would be:
```
/usr/bin/ssh-keygen -q -t ecdsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key -N ''
```
