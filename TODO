A rough list of things I need to work on:
* More rules!
* Adding groups to existing and future rules
* Replacing XXX with real descriptions
* Documentation on rule/decoder writing
* Clean up the sshd rules/decoders

Things I'm planning on trying to find rules for:
* openldap/OpenBSD's ldapd
* I'd love to get some procurve logs (and a switch or two ;))
