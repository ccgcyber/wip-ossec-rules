Directory structure:
newlogs - This file contains new logs that have not been sorted yet.
logs/* - These files contain collected logs for various programs.
ossec/rules/* - These files (except local_rules.xml) are from OSSEC snapshots, and are being used for testing.
ossec/rules/local_rules.xml - This file contains the new rules for testing.
ossec/etc/* - These files (except local_decoder.xml) are from the OSSEC snapshots, and are being used for testing.
ossec/etc/local_decoder.xml - This file contains the new decoders for testing.
wip_rules - These rules can be used, but have not been submitted to the OSSEC project.
wip_decoders - These decoders can be used, but have not been submitted to the OSSEC project.



Regress testing:
Regress testing can be done on individual log sets. The ossec directory should contain the ossec rulesets, as 
well as a populated local_rules.xml. The decoders are also present, and should be up to date. Inside of the 
ossec directory the following command can be used to test a log set and save the output to a file:
  cat ../logs/logfile | /var/ossec/bin/ossec-logtest -D . -c etc/ossec.conf 2>&1 | grep -v \
    'ossec-testrule: INFO: Started' > ../results/logfile.results
The "logfile.results" can be compared to previous runs with the following command (as long as the command 
has been run previously for that logset):
  hg diff results/logfile.results
Regressions should be easy to spot if there were no changes to the rule set or decoders being tested. For 
new rulesets/decoders, going through the file by hand may be the best option right now.
